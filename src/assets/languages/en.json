    "THE_QUICK_BILL_FEATURE": "The Quick Bill feature is designed to streamline the billing process by allowing you to add products in two different ways:\n1) Directly entering the product price.\n2) Using a quick code to add the product.\n\nThis feature enables faster bill generation by offering flexible methods for adding products, making the billing process more efficient and time-saving.",
    "QUICK_CODE_USED": "What is a Quick Code and how is it used?",
    "QUICK_CODE_4_DIGIT": "A Quick Code is a 4-digit code that can be used as a barcode for products that do not have an available barcode. ( For example, codes like A123 or CD12 can be used ). When using a Quick Code, it is necessary to include at least one alphabet character. This allows you to efficiently add products without an existing barcode.",
    "HOW_CAN_I_ADD_PRODUCT": "How can I add a product in the POS system?",
    "IN_THE_POS_SYSTEM": "In the POS system, you can add a product using two methods:\n1) Scanning the Barcode: Simply scan the product's barcode to add it.\n2) Manual Entry: Alternatively, you can manually enter the product details to add it to the system.\n\nThese options provide flexibility in how products are added during transactions.",
    "ADDITIONAL_REPORT": "How can I get additional reports?",
    "IF_YOU_NEED_ADDITIONAL_REPORTS": "If you need additional reports, you can request by sending an email to us. You will receive a response within 5 business days.",
    "HOW_DO_I_OPEN_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT": "How do I open a customer's account and manage their payments?",
    "TO_OPEN_CUSTOMER_ACCOUNT": "To open a customer's account, you must first add the customer to the system. Once the customer is added, you have the option to take partial payment and add balance in customer record. This means that if the customer makes a partial payment, the remaining balance can be kept in their account. They can clear this balance at any time, either during their next purchase or at a later date.\n\nYou can add a customer in two ways:\n1) From the Homepage: Use the customer option available on the homepage to enter the customer's basic information and add them to the system.\n2) During Bill Generation: You can also add a customer while generating a bill.\n\nThis allows the billing information to be recorded under the customer's name. Both methods ensure that customer information is properly integrated into the system.",
    "ADD_STAFF_MEMBER_SYSTEM": "How do I add a staff member to the system?",
    "ADD_A_STAFF_MEMBER": "To add a new staff member, \n(1) go to Settings, \n(2) then Staff, \n(3) and click the plus sign (+) in the top right corner. \nFill in the staff member's cell number and other required details, then select their role (Staff or Manager). After you’ve added them, ask the staff member to download the application on their mobile device and sign up using the cell number. The account will automatically link to your store if the cell number was added as staff before their sign-up. If they signed up without being added, they will need to go to Settings, delete their account, and sign up again after you’ve added them as staff. It’s essential to add staff before they log in to ensure their accounts are properly linked to your store.",
    "UPDATING_STOCK": "What is the process for updating stock?",
    "TYPES_OF_STOCK": "To update stock, follow these steps:\nIncrease Stock Quantity: You can increase the quantity of a product by updating the stock.\nDecrease Stock Quantity: Similarly, you can decrease the stock by removing the quantity from the current stock.\n\nThese actions allow you to manage and adjust your stock levels as needed.",
    "HOW_DO_GENERATE_BILL": "How do I generate a bill?",
    "GENERATE_BILL_DETAIL": "To generate a bill, you can follow these steps:\n\n1) Add Products to Bill by doing either of the following:\nA) Scan the Product: Scan the product barcode to add it to the bill.\nB) Search Manually: Search for the product manually and add it to the bill.\nC) Stocks: Add product to bill from Stocks.\n\n2) Customer Handling:\nWhen new Bill is generated, Customer will be added as Walk-In Customer. Parital Payments are not allowed for Walk-In Customers and to use partial payment you need to create customer or select existing customer. You can do this in three easy steps:\nA) Create New Customers: First click on 'Walk-In Customer'. Second click on plus icon next to search bar. Third fill in Customer details and Save.\nB) For Existing Customers: First click on 'Walk-In Customer'. Second search for existing customer by either their cell number or their name. Third click on customer to select.\n\n3) Finalize the Bill:\nOnce the products are added and the customer details are entered, press 'Create Bill'. Enter discount (if any) and cash collected. Press 'Generate Bill' to finalize the bill.\n\nOnce bill is generated, an invoice can be printed or extracted as needed. This process ensures that billing is flexible and accommodates New, Existing and Walk-In Customers.",
